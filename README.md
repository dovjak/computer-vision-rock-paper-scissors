## Milestone 1

Using a Teachable Machine an image project model was creted including 4 classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. Each class was trained with approximately 420 images.The model was downloaded from 'Tensorflow' tab from the Teachable Machine which contains the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. 

This model is 

The model will be used for the project

## Milestone 1

Using a Teachable Machine an image project model was creasing including 4 classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. Each class was trained with approximately 420 images.The model was donloaded from 'Tensorflow tab from the Teachable Machine which contains the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model.

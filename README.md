# Computer Vision Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is created to read hand signs of rock, paper and scissors shown on camera. This was done in help with Teachable machine, which has the ability to easily create machine learning models using sample data inputs.

## Milestone 1

Using a Teachable Machine an image project model was creted including 4 classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. Each class was trained with approximately 420 images.The model was downloaded from 'Tensorflow' tab from the Teachable Machine which contains the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. 

The model created with Teachable Machine will contribute to reading hand signs when either rock, paper or scissors is displayed. The pathway is needed to the model in order the hand signs to be read.
